Running on OpenShift
--------------------

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/

Create a ruby application (ruby-1.8 or ruby-1.9)

	rhc app create -a redmine -t ruby-1.9  # or ruby-1.8

Add mysql support to your application
    
	rhc app cartridge add -a redmine -c mysql-5.1

Make a note of the username, password, and host name as you will need to use these to login to the mysql database

Add this upstream Redmine quickstart repo

	cd redmine
	git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/redmine-2.0-openshift-quickstart.git
	git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master

Then push the repo upstream

	git push

That's it, you can now checkout your application at:

	http://redmine-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com


Use the following to login to your new Redmine application running on OpenShift:

	username: admin
	password: admin


Changing the default admin password
-----------------------------------
Once your installation is complete, it is highly recommended that you change
the password for the Redmine admin user - see the Change password link at:
